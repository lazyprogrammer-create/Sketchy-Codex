# Sketchy-Codex
          Sketchy Codex was created with a clear goal in mind: to make Java code learning and resource access easier and more efficient for Sketchware Pro users. As many developers using Sketchware Pro faced challenges in finding clean, well-organized Java examples and compatible components or libraries, Sketchy Codex was built to fill that gap—by bringing everything together into one powerful, offline-ready app.
          This app is designed specifically for the Sketchware Pro development community—from beginners just starting to explore Android app development to experienced users looking to streamline their workflow with ready-to-use code and tools. Whether you're learning Java, experimenting with logic, or building real-world apps in Sketchware Pro, Sketchy Codex is built to support your journey.
          We take user feedback seriously and are constantly working to fix bugs, resolve issues, and improve the app experience. Each update brings new features, better performance, and smarter tools based on what users need most. Sketchy Codex continues to grow with its community—supporting your creativity, learning, and productivity in Sketchware Pro.
