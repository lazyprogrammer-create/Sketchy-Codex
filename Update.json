Palette, Components, and Local Libraries, expanding your development toolkit with more ready-to-use functionality.\n\\t\\t▫ The first version for Sketchy Codex was recently rediscovered from our social media post, and this version is now available again in the version 1.0 changelog for those interested in the app\u0027s early beginnings.\n\n⦁ Updated : \n\\t\\t▫ Several existing Code Palette entries have been improved for better performance, readability, and compatibility.\n\n⦁ Improved : \n\\t\\t▫ Enhanced organization and structure for easier searching and integration of components and libraries.\n\\t\\t▫ Updated the file-saving logic to prevent confusion when saving files with existing names.\n➝ Before : my file v1.0 1.zip (could be mistaken for a version number)\n➝ Now : my file v1.0 (1).zip — a clearer format that distinguishes duplicates from actual versioning.\n\n⦁ UI Enhancements : \n\\t\\t▫ Improved activity transitions using Z-axis animations.\n\\t\\t▫ Updated outline

feedback.\n\n⦁ Performance : \n\\t\\t▫ Removed unused files and cleaned up unnecessary resources.\n\\t\\t▫ Fixed launch lag between splash screen and home — now transitions smoothly using a lightweight preloaded empty view, similar to SearchView.\n\n⦁ Compatibility : \n\\t\\t▫ Dropped support for Android 5.0–5.1 (API 21–22).\n\\t\\t▫ Minimum required OS is now Android 6.0 (API 23).\n\n⦁
